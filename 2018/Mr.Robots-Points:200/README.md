# Mr. Robots - Points: 200

1. First, lets go through the website : http://2018shell.picoctf.com:60945/
2. Then, we could find out a keyword "robots". As you can see, it's all about  "robots.txt"
3. So, I type http://2018shell.picoctf.com:60945/robots.txt to get the disallow url : http://2018shell.picoctf.com:60945/65c0c.html and get the flag.
4. Here is the flag : picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_3lli0t_65c0c}
