# picobrowser

1. First, lets go through the website : https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49789/
2. Then, we read the discription : "This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag!"
3. So, we know that we have to become "picobrowser", as we can think, we have to change the user-agent to "picobrowser". Then we can get the flag.
4. Here is the flag : picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_55e7edbc}
